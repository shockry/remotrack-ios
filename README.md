# RemoTrack

RemoTrack uses Bluetooth Low Energy to get the phone to communicate with the browser, this means a safe, very fast and responsive experience and access from anywhere.

This is the ios controller app.

> Because I wanted this to be free to use, and paying the Apple Developer fee just to release this app is a little high for me at the moment, I thought open sourcing it is a nice way to share it with others.

Features
--------

* Play in the browser, fully control with your own phone.
* Your controls are the phone sensors and an action button for more interactivity.
* Pair-and-forget experience. 
* Best score is saved on the phone rather than the browser, so you are carrying your best score wherever you go.
* In case of loss, you are presented with a "play again" button on the phone (it vibrates, too :D).

How to run
----------

This is how I run it (it's my first iOS app, forgive my noobness):

Connect your iPhone to your Mac, run the app from Xcode and trust me as a developer :D
